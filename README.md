In the Job App which is an React Native application, I have accomplished the following:

• Designed visually appealing UI/UX interfaces.

• Implemented the functionality to fetch data from an external API and seamlessly integrate it into the application.

• Developed search and pagination features to enhance user experience and navigation within the app.

• Created custom API data fetching hooks to efficiently retrieve data from the API.
